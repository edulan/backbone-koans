# Backbone Koans

A set of jasmine powered koans for learning [Backbone.js](http://http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone).

The koans verify behavior of a Todo list app, a modified version of the original Todos app
created by [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](http://jgn.me/).

## How to Run

Open your favorite browser, and load the specrunner.html file. You should see many failing specs.

Work your way through the jasmine specs in the js/koans directory, and when you finish you should have
a better understanding of how to create and test a Backbone app.
